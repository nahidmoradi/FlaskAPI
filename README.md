ðŸ§  Program Overview:

This is a Flask-based web service that integrates with a SQL Server database and uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT model (ChatGPT) to analyze user questions and determine which backend function should be executed. It then fetches relevant data from the database and returns it as a JSON response.
ðŸ§© Main Components of the Program:
1. Database Connection (SQL Server):

    Database credentials (server, DB name, username, password, driver) are loaded from environment variables using os.getenv.

    The pyodbc library is used to execute stored procedures in the SQL Server.

2. Data Processing Functions:

Two main functions are defined to retrieve data from the database:

    GetRegions(start_date, end_date) â†’ Retrieves a list of regions between two dates.

    GetListOfCities(start_date, end_date) â†’ Retrieves a list of cities between two dates.

Each function calls a corresponding SQL stored procedure (GetRegions, GetListOfCities) and returns the results in dictionary (JSON-like) format.
3. User Question Analysis via GPT:

The get_function_suggestions(question) function:

    Sends the userâ€™s question to the GPT-3.5 model.

    GPT returns the name(s) of relevant functions based on semantic and keyword analysis.

    If no relevant function is found, GPT responds with "No related function found".

4. Main Endpoint: /function_selection

This is a POST endpoint that accepts:

    question â†’ The userâ€™s question.

    start_date, end_date â†’ Optional date filters (default values provided).

The endpoint performs the following steps:

    Calls GPT to suggest the most relevant function based on the question.

    Executes the selected function (e.g., GetRegions or GetListOfCities) using the given date range.

    Returns the result to the client as a JSON response.

ðŸ§ª Example Usage:

Suppose a POST request is sent like this:
curl -X POST -F "question=Give me the list of regions" -F "start_date=2023-01-01" -F "end_date=2023-12-31" http://127.0.0.1:3000/function_selection
Hereâ€™s what happens:

    The GPT model suggests the GetRegions function.

    That function is executed with the given date range.

    The list of regions is returned as a JSON response.

âœ… Benefits of This Program:

    Smart interaction between user queries and backend logic.

    Clear separation of question understanding (AI) and data fetching (SQL).

    Easily extendable: just update the list of functions in get_function_suggestions.

    Perfect for building intelligent enterprise-level chatbots or API layers.
